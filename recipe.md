How to make Mango Lassi
Puree Mangoes
1. Rinse, peel and chop 3 to 4 medium-sized mangoes. You need about 2 cups of chopped mangoes.

Add the chopped mangoes in a blender. Add 4 to 5 tablespoons sugar or honey or any sweetener of your choice. 

2. Add flavorings of your choice â€“  8 to 10 saffron strands.

3. Blend everything until smooth. The consistency is pulpy and mushy without any fine chunks of mangoes.

4. Add 2 cups chilled curd (dahi) or yogurt and 2 to 3 tablespoons light cream. Note that adding cream is optional.

5. Add 4 to 5 ice cubes (optional). If you want a slightly thin consistency, add some water or milk to the lassi while blending.

6. Blend until all the ingredients are mixed evenly and the yogurt has become smooth. Taste a few spoons of mango lassi. If it tastes slightly sour or tangy or is not sweet enough according to your taste, add some teaspoons of sugar and blend again.

7. Pour mango lassi in glasses.

8. Serve straightaway.

Suggestions

Enjoy Mango Lassi as is or choose to top or garnish with herbs or nuts. For herbs, mint leaves are the best flavor pairing with both mangoes and yogurt. The lassi can be topped with some chopped mango cubes as well.
